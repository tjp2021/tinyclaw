# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for TinyClaw. ADRs document significant technical decisions, the context behind them, alternatives considered, and trade-offs.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Decision**: What did we decide?
- **Alternatives**: What else did we consider?
- **Consequences**: What are the implications?
